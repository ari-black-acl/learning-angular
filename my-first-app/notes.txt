angular app files are in /src
    - top level html template, style sheet, main function, app icon

angular app component files are in /app
    - app-root component is the top level component, app.ts is its src file
    - app.css is the style sheet for root, and new components are added here

images in /assets

extensions
    - .angular      -> required to build app (in .gitignore)
    - /e2e          -> files to test app
    - .node_modules -> app's node.js packages (in .gitignore)
    - angular.json  -> describes app to app building tools
    - package.json  -> used by npm to run finished app
    - tsconfig.*    -> describe app's configuration to TS compiler

creating new components
    - done automatically by ng -> ng generate component <name>

html tags
    - elements start and end with tags (<tag> </tag>)
        - all opening tabs begin sections of page content, and they all look the same
        - not all elements have closing tabs 
            - container tags (containing content) end in </tag>
            - non-container tags can start and end with in the same tag (no closing tag) <tag args />
